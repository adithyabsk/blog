I recently got 8.5 hours of the best sleep of my adult life--a culmination of a
month of being mindful of my sleep habits. We spend anywhere between a
quarter to half of our lives asleep. Yet, it doesn't seem many people are
intentional about this aspect of their lives.

I have been interested in sleep tracking since I was in high school, but have
not actively tried to improve my perceived quality. Over the past year I tried
to change that and have felt a noticeable improvement. I posted a story on
Instagram to my extended friends circle, which received more feedback than I
expected. A lot of people were interested in what I was doing to optimize my
sleep, so I thought I'd share.

## Software

The cornerstone of getting better sleep is tracking it. As the adage goes, _you
can't manage what you can't measure_. I've been using
[Sleep Cycle,](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sleep-cycle-sleep-tracker/id320606217)
which is
[one](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sleep-watch-by-bodymatter/id1138066420)
[of](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pillow-auto-sleep-tracker/id878691772)
[many](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/autosleep-track-sleep-on-watch/id1164801111)
apps that claim to track your sleep. I bought the Sleep Cycle app waaay back
in 2014. Anecdotally, I've found their cycle tracking to be somewhat
accurate and their ability to wake me in "non-deep" sleep pretty spot on. The
concept of
[sleep cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_cycle) is borne out in the
science literature (i.e. the difference between
[REM sleep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep)
and non-REM sleep). And it seems that at least one
[sleep researcher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjPng54_CtE)
found that the app did correlate to real sleep cycles. Most of all, I like the
sleep score, regularity, and other statistics that the app lays out bare for you
to draw your own conclusions. I also happen to be an early adopter, so I've been
grandfathered into the subscription features.

## White Noise

![Sleep Quality vs Weather](https://i.imgur.com/Jnvr1Re.jpg){: width="80%"}

The second thing I noticed was that the Sleep Cycle app consistently reported
higher sleep scores on rainy nights. The white noise that a fan makes has always
helped me fall asleep--since I was a kid. So, I started using the app's
built-in "Rain on Car Roof" sleep aid on top of the fan I have running in
my room. I have since been falling asleep much faster.

## Weighted Blanket

The third piece of sleep "technology"--likely the secret sauce--has been a
[weighted blanket.](https://chillablankets.com/)
[The](https://web.archive.org/web/20220122141045/https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.8636)
[science](https://www.pennmedicine.org/updates/blogs/health-and-wellness/2019/february/weighted-blankets)
seems to suggest that weighted blankets can help with sleep disorders. I do not
think I have any major issues with sleep, but I've found that a weighted blanket
improves my sleep score. I've only had mine for ~1 month, but
the initial data shows an upward trending sleep score.

## Qualitative Observations

On the even more anecdotal side, I've found that a couple of other key factors
help the cause:

- Being tired before bed (especially from working out that day)
- Not having eaten food 1.5 hours before bed
- Waking up at a consistent time
- Refraining from phone screen-time in bed

I've found that bedtime matters less for me personally. Looking into it, it
seems some doctors
[have echoed similar ideas.](https://www.headspace.com/articles/sleep-health-2-consistent-wake-up-time-sleeps-surprising-mvp)

## Social Media

The hardest habit that I have broken this year was scrolling on social media
before bed. I would say this is the second most important aspect to better
sleep. I've found that killing a habit without replacing it / concessions
doesn't work. Here were mine: I allow myself to instead listen to podcasts at
night, which seems to have filled that gap. I try to pick ones that are on the
shorter side, like 20ish minutes, which also seems to give me a chance to wind
down. Second, I deleted all social media apps on my phone but give myself
unlimited time to browse on a desktop computer. Desktop sites don't seem to have
as optimized algorithms for endless scrolling. [^1] I've found that there are
more natural stopping points when you are on a desktop computer.

## Waking up

The part of sleep that people sometimes forget to talk about is waking up.
I've already talked about using an app to try to wake up in a lighter phase of
sleep. In addition, I've found that a waking up routine really helps.

I make sure to have a full water bottle at night--a swig of water in the morning
wakes me right up. I also run through a couple of cards on
[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
and run through an exercise on
[Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/). [^2] [^3]
Though not critical, I've found that doing these mental exercises wakes my mind
up and stops me from drifting back to sleep. It also acts as a two-for-one since
I make sure to keep the habit in both apps going since I do it first thing in
the morning.

## The Results

![Sleep Cycle Trend Line](https://i.imgur.com/DTjMO7I.jpg){: width="60%"}

This is a snapshot of sleep cycle over the last couple of months. I had taken a
break from tracking my sleep at the start of the pandemic, but got back into it
when I was at Carnegie Mellon in person for grad school. I put into practice
some waking up habits in mid-November, but I really kicked up the focus in late
December with the weighted blankets, social media restrictions, and white noise.
I plan to continue to track the results of these changes this year.

## Summary

The long-short of it all, in rough relative order of importance:

- Track your sleep with a [sleep tracking app](https://www.sleepcycle.com/)
- Get a [weighted blanket](https://chillablankets.com/)
- Refrain from phone use in bed
- Use a sleep aid (specifically [rain sounds](https://www.sleepcycle.com/sleep-sounds-music/sounds-to-sleep-by/))
- Exercise on days you want to get good sleep (being tired)
- Implement instant wake up habits (e.g. drinking water)
- Have a regular wake-up time
- Eat food 1.5 hours before bed
