## The Use Case
If you are like me, you often need to grab a part of a large GitHub repository. Maybe,
you're copying configs from another project or grabbing part of a template repository:
this trick has you covered. While git has a new feature to
["clone" and filter][git_feat] part of a repo, that's often not what is needed.

[git_feat]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/600079/how-do-i-clone-a-subdirectory-only-of-a-git-repository/52269934#52269934 "Clone and filter feature"

## SVN to the Rescue
Since GitHub has built in SVN support, you can use use it pull down just part of a repo!

```console
$ svn export https://github.com/{USER}/{PROJECT}/trunk/{PATH} {DEST}
```

#### Example
I recently used this to quickly pull the latest scss changes from `minima`.

```console
$ svn export https://github.com/jekyll/minima/trunk/_sass/minima _sass/minima 
```
