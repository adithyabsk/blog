We spend anywhere between a quarter to half of our lives asleep. Yet, it doesn't seem many people are intentional about this aspect of their lives.<p>I have been interested in sleep tracking since I was in high school, but have not actively tried to improve my perceived quality. Over the past year I tried to change that and have felt a noticeable improvement. I posted a story on Instagram to my extended friends circle, which received more feedback than I expected. A lot of people were interested in what I was doing to optimize my sleep, so I thought I'd share.<figure class=opt-image data-format=jpg data-mime=image/jpeg><a href=https://www.adithyabalaji.com/posts/sleep/story.jpeg rel=noopener target=_blank> <picture><source srcset=https://www.adithyabalaji.com/processed_images/story.867e835e7e61531c.webp type=image/webp><source srcset=https://www.adithyabalaji.com/processed_images/story.3da973ff6f874a8d.jpg type=image/jpeg><source srcset=https://www.adithyabalaji.com/processed_images/story.24805656fe39c893.webp type=image/webp><source srcset=https://www.adithyabalaji.com/processed_images/story.07fecbf56dd152a4.jpg type=image/jpeg><img alt="Sleep Cycle Instagram Story" decoding=async height=2210 loading=lazy src=https://www.adithyabalaji.com/processed_images/story.3da973ff6f874a8d.jpg style=aspect-ratio:1242/2210 width=1242></picture> </a></figure><h2 id=software><a aria-label="Anchor link for: software" class=zola-anchor href=#software>#</a> Software</h2><p>The cornerstone of getting better sleep is tracking it. As the adage goes, <em>you can't manage what you can't measure</em>. I've been using <a href=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sleep-cycle-sleep-tracker/id320606217 rel=noopener target=_blank>Sleep Cycle,</a> which is <a href=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sleep-watch-by-bodymatter/id1138066420 rel=noopener target=_blank>one</a> <a href=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pillow-auto-sleep-tracker/id878691772 rel=noopener target=_blank>of</a> <a href=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/autosleep-track-sleep-on-watch/id1164801111 rel=noopener target=_blank>many</a> apps that claim to track your sleep. I bought the Sleep Cycle app waaay back in 2014. Anecdotally, I've found their cycle tracking to be somewhat accurate and their ability to wake me in "non-deep" sleep pretty spot on. The concept of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_cycle rel=noopener target=_blank>sleep cycles</a> is borne out in the science literature (i.e. the difference between <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_eye_movement_sleep rel=noopener target=_blank>REM sleep</a> and non-REM sleep). And it seems that at least one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjPng54_CtE" rel=noopener target=_blank>sleep researcher</a> found that the app did correlate to real sleep cycles. Most of all, I like the sleep score, regularity, and other statistics that the app lays out bare for you to draw your own conclusions. I also happen to be an early adopter, so I've been grandfathered into the subscription features.<h2 id=white-noise><a aria-label="Anchor link for: white-noise" class=zola-anchor href=#white-noise>#</a> White Noise</h2><figure class=opt-image data-format=jpg data-mime=image/jpeg><a href=https://www.adithyabalaji.com/posts/sleep/affected.jpeg rel=noopener target=_blank> <picture><source srcset=https://www.adithyabalaji.com/processed_images/affected.936f660049420cbe.webp type=image/webp><source srcset=https://www.adithyabalaji.com/processed_images/affected.03c0a3afd9f41583.jpg type=image/jpeg><source srcset=https://www.adithyabalaji.com/processed_images/affected.36870d73bf38b5d2.webp type=image/webp><source srcset=https://www.adithyabalaji.com/processed_images/affected.376c8ef1ecb613a5.jpg type=image/jpeg><img alt="Sleep Quality vs Weather" decoding=async height=1058 loading=lazy src=https://www.adithyabalaji.com/processed_images/affected.03c0a3afd9f41583.jpg style=aspect-ratio:1242/1058 width=1242></picture> </a></figure><p>The second thing I noticed was that the Sleep Cycle app consistently reported higher sleep scores on rainy nights. The white noise that a fan makes has always helped me fall asleep--since I was a kid. So, I started using the app's built-in "Rain on Car Roof" sleep aid on top of the fan I have running in my room. I have since been falling asleep much faster.<h2 id=weighted-blanket><a aria-label="Anchor link for: weighted-blanket" class=zola-anchor href=#weighted-blanket>#</a> Weighted Blanket</h2><p>The third piece of sleep "technology"--likely the secret sauce--has been a <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20230130005935/https://chillablankets.com/ rel=noopener target=_blank>weighted blanket.</a> <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20220122141045/https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.8636 rel=noopener target=_blank>The</a> <a href=https://www.pennmedicine.org/updates/blogs/health-and-wellness/2019/february/weighted-blankets rel=noopener target=_blank>science</a> seems to suggest that weighted blankets can help with sleep disorders. I do not think I have any major issues with sleep, but I've found that a weighted blanket improves my sleep score. I've only had mine for ~1 month, but the initial data shows an upward trending sleep score.<h2 id=qualitative-observations><a aria-label="Anchor link for: qualitative-observations" class=zola-anchor href=#qualitative-observations>#</a> Qualitative Observations</h2><p>On the even more anecdotal side, I've found that a couple of other key factors help the cause:<ul><li>Being tired before bed (especially from working out that day)<li>Not having eaten food 1.5 hours before bed<li>Waking up at a consistent time<li>Refraining from phone screen-time in bed</ul><p>I've found that bedtime matters less for me personally. Looking into it, it seems some doctors <a href=https://www.headspace.com/articles/sleep-health-2-consistent-wake-up-time-sleeps-surprising-mvp rel=noopener target=_blank>have echoed similar ideas.</a><h2 id=social-media><a aria-label="Anchor link for: social-media" class=zola-anchor href=#social-media>#</a> Social Media</h2><p>The hardest habit that I have broken this year was scrolling on social media before bed. I would say this is the second most important aspect to better sleep. I've found that killing a habit without replacing it / concessions doesn't work. Here were mine: I allow myself to instead listen to podcasts at night, which seems to have filled that gap. I try to pick ones that are on the shorter side, like 20ish minutes, which also seems to give me a chance to wind down. Second, I deleted all social media apps on my phone but give myself unlimited time to browse on a desktop computer. Desktop sites don't seem to have as optimized algorithms for endless scrolling. <sup class=footnote-reference id=fr-1-1><a href=#fn-1>1</a></sup> I've found that there are more natural stopping points when you are on a desktop computer.<h2 id=waking-up><a aria-label="Anchor link for: waking-up" class=zola-anchor href=#waking-up>#</a> Waking up</h2><p>The part of sleep that people sometimes forget to talk about is waking up. I've already talked about using an app to try to wake up in a lighter phase of sleep. In addition, I've found that a waking up routine really helps.<p>I make sure to have a full water bottle at night--a swig of water in the morning wakes me right up. I also run through a couple of cards on <a href=https://apps.ankiweb.net/ rel=noopener target=_blank>Anki</a> and run through an exercise on <a href=https://www.duolingo.com/ rel=noopener target=_blank>Duolingo</a>. <sup class=footnote-reference id=fr-2-1><a href=#fn-2>2</a></sup> <sup class=footnote-reference id=fr-3-1><a href=#fn-3>3</a></sup> Though not critical, I've found that doing these mental exercises wakes my mind up and stops me from drifting back to sleep. It also acts as a two-for-one since I make sure to keep the habit in both apps going since I do it first thing in the morning.<h2 id=the-results><a aria-label="Anchor link for: the-results" class=zola-anchor href=#the-results>#</a> The Results</h2><figure class=opt-image data-format=jpg data-mime=image/jpeg><a href=https://www.adithyabalaji.com/posts/sleep/trendline.jpeg rel=noopener target=_blank> <picture><source srcset=https://www.adithyabalaji.com/processed_images/trendline.7a31c9df5a30bf28.webp type=image/webp><source srcset=https://www.adithyabalaji.com/processed_images/trendline.1e51378fff12d9e5.jpg type=image/jpeg><source srcset=https://www.adithyabalaji.com/processed_images/trendline.7685b1fcf0481bd1.webp type=image/webp><source srcset=https://www.adithyabalaji.com/processed_images/trendline.ddc8e29579a38ba4.jpg type=image/jpeg><img alt="Sleep Cycle Trend Line" decoding=async height=1341 loading=lazy src=https://www.adithyabalaji.com/processed_images/trendline.1e51378fff12d9e5.jpg style=aspect-ratio:1242/1341 width=1242></picture> </a></figure><p>This is a snapshot of sleep cycle over the last couple of months. I had taken a break from tracking my sleep at the start of the pandemic, but got back into it when I was at Carnegie Mellon in person for grad school. I put into practice some waking up habits in mid-November, but I really kicked up the focus in late December with the weighted blankets, social media restrictions, and white noise. I plan to continue to track the results of these changes this year.<h2 id=summary><a aria-label="Anchor link for: summary" class=zola-anchor href=#summary>#</a> Summary</h2><p>The long-short of it all, in rough relative order of importance:<ul><li>Track your sleep with a <a href=https://www.sleepcycle.com/ rel=noopener target=_blank>sleep tracking app</a><li>Get a <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20230130005935/https://chillablankets.com/ rel=noopener target=_blank>weighted blanket</a><li>Refrain from phone use in bed<li>Use a sleep aid (specifically <a href=https://www.sleepcycle.com/sleep-sounds-music/sounds-to-sleep-by/ rel=noopener target=_blank>rain sounds</a>)<li>Exercise on days you want to get good sleep (being tired)<li>Implement instant wake up habits (e.g. drinking water)<li>Have a regular wake-up time<li>Eat food 1.5 hours before bed</ul><p>Thanks to Matt Figdore, Simon Berens, Daniel Alfonsetti, Svapnil Ankolkar, and Aishwarya Balaji for providing feedback on earlier versions of this post.<p><strong>Edit 2022-02-22</strong>: The post got some traction on Hacker News-- <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30410310" rel=noopener target=_blank>check out the discussion there</a><hr><footer class=footnotes><ol class=footnotes-list><li id=fn-1><p>I manually delete and re-download Instagram stories on days I want to post, since it's honestly the only real way to stay in touch with friends async. <a href=#fr-1-1>↩</a></p><li id=fn-2><p>Anki is a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition rel=noopener target=_blank>spaced repetition</a> memory app. <a href=#fr-2-1>↩</a></p><li id=fn-3><p>Duolingo is a language learners app. I'm currently using it to learn Spanish and have a streak of 130 days! <a href=#fr-3-1>↩</a></p></ol></footer><div class=newsletter-section><h2>Stay Updated</h2><p>I write about robotics, machine learning, and software engineering.
